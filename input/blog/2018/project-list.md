This is a non-exhaustive list of projects that I can complete as exercise for learning new languages.
Some of this was gleaned from [this list](https://github.com/karan/Projects), and some of it wasn't.

I'll update this with links to every implementation of any given project I do in any given language.

# Projects

## Battleship
The classic board game in ASCII against a very simple AI.

## Bubblesort
Just implement bubblesort.

## Budget Tracker
Create an app that will aid in finances.
It should keep track of monthly income, and expenses.
The user should be able to input an amount of money, expressed as a percent, of the net monthly income to put in savings.
Finally, the app should inform the user how much they can spend on a weekly basis.

## Caesar Cipher
I think everybody probably knows what this guy is.
Here's a [Wiki Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) to it just in case.

## Change Finder
Implement a change finder. But instead of printing out the change as a number, we should print out the exact amount of tender we need.
Example:
```
Enter cost:
-> 10
Enter amount payed:
-> 10.31

Change: $0.31; 1 quarter, 1 nickel, and 1 penny.
```

## Code Snippet Manager
Create a code snippet manager.

## Command Script
A simple scripting language which is command driven. So basically a DSL.
Example:
```
var(hello, "Hello, World!")
var(num, 0)

LOOP
if(num == 3, END)
add(num, 1)
goto LOOP

END
print(That was fun!)
```

## Diffie-Hellman Key Generation
Implement the Diffie-Hellman key generation algorithm.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)

## Dungeon-Crawler
Create a dungeon-crawler using ASCII graphics.
It should be able to randomly generate dungeons.
Difficulty should progress.

## Gofish
Implement the (card) game of *GoFish* in ASCII, and allow the user to play against the computer.

## GPA Calculator
Given a set of input grades, calculate a GPA.

## Hash generator
Implement a hashcode generator.

## IP Locater
Roughly resolve an IP Address's physical location.

## Number Guessing Game
The program randomly selects a number from 0 - 100 and the user must guess what that number is. Whenever the user is wrong, the computer tells them if their guess was too low or too high. Bonus points if we make it work the other way where the user picks the number and the computer guesses it.

## Pig Latin Translator
Implement a [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin) translator capable of going either `English -> Pig Latin` or `Pig Latin -> English`.

## RSS Feed Analyzer
Allow the user to enter in the URL for an RSS feed.
Then analyze the feed and pretty-print the results.

## Sieve of Eratosthenes
Find all prime numbers up to a user-defined point.
See: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

## TCP Client/Server Messaging
A simple program which allows users to chat with each other over a TCP connection. Bonus points if the users can create different chat rooms. Also encryption would be a nice bonus.

## Text-based Adventure Game
Create a little text-based adventure game.

## Zip
Implement an algorithm for zipping/unzipping data/files.
